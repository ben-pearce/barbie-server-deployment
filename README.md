# ðŸš› Backup Server Deployment

This repository holds my docker compose files and configuration files for services I host on my backup server. Remote storage repositories are mounted with rclone and incremental backups performed with borgmatic.

## Containers

| **Name** | **Description** | **Ports** | **Links** |
|---|---|---|---|
| [borgmatic](./docker-compose.yml#L5)  | Simple, configuration-driven backup software. |  | [GitHub](https://github.com/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic) |
| [rclone](./docker-compose.yml#L35)  | Command-line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers. |  | [Website](https://rclone.org/) |
| [zabbix-agent](./docker-compose.yml#L59)  | Zabbix agent for monitoring. |  | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zabbix/zabbix-agent) |



## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.
