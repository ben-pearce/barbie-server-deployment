# ðŸš› Backup Server Deployment

This repository holds my docker compose files and configuration files for services I host on my backup server. Remote storage repositories are mounted with rclone and incremental backups performed with borgmatic.

## Containers

| **Name** | **Description** | **Ports** | **Links** |
|---|---|---|---|
| [borgmatic](./docker-compose.yml#L8)  | Simple, configuration-driven backup software. |  | [GitHub](https://github.com/borgmatic-collective/borgmatic) |
| [rclone](./docker-compose.yml#L41)  | Command-line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers. |  | [Website](https://rclone.org/) |



## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

| **Variable** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP mail server host. | `mail.example.com` |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username. | `postmaster@example.com` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for all containers. | `Europe/London` |
| `CONFIG_DIR` | Location of config storage on host. | `.config` |
| `DATA_DIR` | Location of data storage on host. | `.data` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Administrative email address. | `somebody@email.com` |
